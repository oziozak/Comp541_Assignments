# Assignment 1 — Word Embeddings & Deep Averaging Networks

**Course:** COMP541 – Deep Learning  
**Topic:** Word Embeddings, Cosine Similarity, and Sentiment Analysis  
**Based on:** Stanford CS224n Assignment  
**Submission format:** Jupyter Notebook + PDF report

---

## Overview

This assignment explores **word representations** and their downstream use in **sentiment classification**.  
The work is divided into three main parts:

1. **Count-based word embeddings** using co-occurrence matrices and SVD  
2. **Prediction-based embeddings** using pre-trained GloVe vectors  
3. **Sentiment analysis** using a Deep Averaging Network (DAN)

All experiments and analyses are implemented in a single Jupyter notebook, and the final results are provided in the accompanying PDF report.
