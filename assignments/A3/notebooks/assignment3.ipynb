    "\n",
    "The inputs to your network will be sequences of character indices. You should\n",

    "effective types of RNNs to use are nn.GRU and nn.LSTM. Their weights should be randomly initialized\n",

    "layer, RNN, and classification layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your own module implemented, the training and eval loop that wraps\n",
    "them will look roughly the same as in previous assignments. First, you need a function\n",
    "to go from the raw string to a PyTorch tensor of indices. Then loop through those examples, zero your\n",
    "gradients, pick up an example, compute the loss, run backpropagation, and update parameters with your\n",
    "optimizer. You should implement this training in train rnn classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using RNNs**\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs and GRUs can be a bit trickier to use than feedforward architectures. First,\n",
    "these expect input tensors of dimension [sequence length, batch size, input size]. You can use the\n",
    "batch first argument to switch whether the sequence length dimension or batch dimension occurs first.\n",
    "If you’re not using batching, you’ll want to pad your sentence with a trivial 1 dimension for the batch.\n",
    "unsqueeze allows you to add trivial dimensions of size 1, and squeeze lets you remove these. Second, an\n",
    "LSTM takes as input a pair of tensors representing the state, h and c. Each is of size [num layers * num\n",
    "directions, batch size, hidden size]. To start with, you probably want a 1-layer RNN just running in the\n",
    "forward direction, so once again you should use unsqueeze to make a 3-tensor with first dimension length\n",
    "of 1. GRUs are similar but only have one hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tensor Manipulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "np.asarray can convert lists into numpy arrays easily. torch.from numpy can\n",
    "convert numpy arrays into PyTorch tensors. torch.FloatTensor(list) can convert from lists directly to\n",
    "PyTorch tensors. .float() and .int() can be used to cast tensors to different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, make sure you can overfit a very small training set as an initial test. If not,\n",
    "you probably have a bug. Then scale up to train on more data and check the development performance\n",
    "of your model.cConsider using small values for hyperparameters so things train quickly. In particular,\n",
    "with only 27 characters, you can get away with small embedding sizes for these, and small hidden sizes\n",

The goal of the problem is to give the entire input to the model, and have the model output what the passcode digit is.\n",

    "* One of two things happened. It was either GRU's achieved high accuracies (85%-99%) and LSTMS accuracy dropped significantly (dropped nearly to 10 %) or both GRU and LSTM achieved worse accuracies (both achieved nearly 10%). This strongly indicates that GRU is the most suitable model for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Size**: I understood how important is the data size one more time. Since both LSTM and GRU improved their accuracies with more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture**: LSTM and GRU are better for tasks that require capturing long range dependencies. Gating mechanisms helped them. Vanilla RNNs suffer from vanishing gradient problem and doesn't learn anything, randomly classifies the given text.\n"
