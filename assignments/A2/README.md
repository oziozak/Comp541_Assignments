# Assignment 2 — Neural Networks & Backpropagation

**Course:** COMP541 – Deep Learning  
**Topic:** Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Backpropagation, and Optimization  
**Submission format:** Jupyter Notebook + PDF report

---

## Overview

This assignment focuses on the fundamentals of **neural networks** and **backpropagation**.  
The goal is to understand how gradients are computed and how learning dynamics are affected by architecture and optimization choices.

The assignment combines theoretical questions with practical experiments implemented in a Jupyter notebook.
