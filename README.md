# COMP541 — Deep Learning Assignments & Project

This repository contains my coursework for **COMP541: Deep Learning**, including all programming assignments and the course project.

Each assignment is organized in a separate folder and includes the corresponding Jupyter notebooks, reports, and supporting files.

## Course Project

### Learned Dynamic Graph Construction for Multi-Sensor Fusion in Autonomous Driving

The course project investigates **learned graph structure learning** for multi-sensor (LiDAR–camera) fusion in autonomous driving.

Key ideas include:
- Replacing fixed graph topologies (e.g., k-NN, radius graphs) with learned connectivity
- Learning sparse, adaptive graphs end-to-end
- Improving efficiency and flexibility of graph-based perception models

Project materials include:
- **Project Proposal:** `COMP441_Proposal.pdf`
- **Progress Report:** `comp441_progress_report_merdem22_ozak23-4.pdf`
- Ongoing implementation and experiments

## Notes

- Large datasets and pretrained weights are not included in this repository.
- All work is intended for **educational purposes** as part of COMP541.
- The repository is structured for clarity, reproducibility, and maintainability.
